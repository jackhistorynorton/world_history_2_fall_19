1. The internet exists and people use it to learn new information.
2. There is more non-evidence based information on the internet than evidence-based information. 
3. More than 50% of searches on google result in no-clicks.
4. Your use of the internet is tracked extensively. 
5. Web pages do not exist, but are conjured upon clicks. 

Consultation: Conversation- Introduce yourself and share at least one thing you have learned that has made you successful in your academic career.
